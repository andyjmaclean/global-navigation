<div>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<h2>This is the Portal (RIGHTS) index</h2>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	Note that clicking "back" on mobile view DOES HAVE a transition on the way down:
	<br/>
	<br/>
	no "back" url has been configured > no new page load happens > we animate			
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	That's unless you're seeing this menu from up a level:
	<br/>
	(with items ["Back...", "Terms of Use", "Rights"  "Jobs"])
	<br/>
	where "Back..." will load a new page (the root index).  
	
</div>
